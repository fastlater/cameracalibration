# Camera Calibration
OpenCV camera calibration with user interface

This tool lets the user create a so called cameramatrix and distortionmatrix for a camera, and store the results.
Calibration is done using a 10 by 7 chessboard pattern.

With the calibrations, and faces in the image, the angle is calculated between the camera direction and the face on the horizontal plane.

The following frameworks were used in this project:
* C#
* Emgu
* Reactive
* WPF
